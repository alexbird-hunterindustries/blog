We continue the series on Organizational Excellence by describing the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (https://trello.com/c/9OdDqJ8C/135-diffusion-of-innovation) and discussing practically how it applies to changes of any kind (e.g. agile transformations, culture shifts, etc.) for teams/companies large and small.
