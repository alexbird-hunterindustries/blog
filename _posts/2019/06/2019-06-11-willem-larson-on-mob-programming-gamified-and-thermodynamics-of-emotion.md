Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things agile and product development from a mob programming perspective. In this episode we have Willem Larson (https://twitter.com/techgreatness) on the show to discuss how Mob Programming was gamified into the RPG (https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg) and the Thermodynamics of Emotion (https://thermodynamicsofemotion.com/).
