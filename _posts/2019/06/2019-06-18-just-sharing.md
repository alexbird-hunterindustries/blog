In this episode we kick off the series on Organizational Excellence by describing how everything that may seem like advice from us is really “just sharing… and not recommending.” It is not just a saying, but stems from an agile mindset rooted in the Cynefin Framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) and a culture of experimentation.
