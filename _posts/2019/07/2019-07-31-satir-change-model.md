Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things agile and product development from a mob programming perspective. In this episode we discuss what the Satir Change Model is (https://trello.com/c/2uMUSe54/157-satir-change-model), how it relates to coping with organizational change, and how to help people progress through each of the stages in the model in a healthy way.
