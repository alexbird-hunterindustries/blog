Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things agile and product development from a mob programming perspective. In this episode we discuss team decision making. Without a command and control leader calling the shots, what are some good ways for teams to make decisions? When people disagree while #MobProgramming, how is the path forward selected? If there is room for improvement in the decisions a team is making, how can you help them improve without making the decisions for them? Chris and Austin discuss these questions and more in this installment of the Mob Mentality Show!
