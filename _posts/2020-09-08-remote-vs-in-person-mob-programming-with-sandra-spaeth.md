Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things agile and product development from a mob programming perspective. After spending multiple years doing full-time in-person mob programming, Sandra Spaeth (https://twitter.com/SandraSpaeth) had to switch to full-time remote mob programming. Now with more than half a year of remote mobbing under her belt, Sandra reflects on her experiences with Chris and Austin. What are the pros \u0026 cons of remote work vs. on-site work? Is one better than the other? With something so high in interpersonal interaction like mob programming, is it even possible for remote to be as good as in-person? Come join the discussion and also pick up some tips, tricks, and experiments to try for the remote life.
