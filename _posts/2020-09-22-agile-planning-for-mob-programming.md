Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things agile and product development from a mob programming perspective. Is there a form of #AgilePlanning that is leaner than #sprint planning? What can #Agile planning look like for a team doing #MobProgramming? Come hear Chris and Austin share how product planning has worked for the #MobProgramming teams they have been on and how it has been dramatically different from not only waterfall but common agile frameworks like #Scrum.
