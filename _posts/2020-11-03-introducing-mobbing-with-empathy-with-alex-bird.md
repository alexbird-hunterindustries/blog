Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things agile and product development from a mob programming perspective. Ever struggled with how to introduce a new practice like Mob Programming with your team? Looking for kind and thoughtful ways to break the ice? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss with Alex Bird (https://twitter.com/alexander_bird) on patterns for introducing mobbing with team members. Alex not only shares ways that have worked well for him, but he also shares how to do so in a way that shows empathy and understanding. Lastly, we cover the \"Mob without teamwork\" antipattern and with example experiments to run to try to help teams out of the rut.
