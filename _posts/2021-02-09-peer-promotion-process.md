Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Do you desire to collaborate and help others but feel like the system you are working in rewards the opposite behavior? What if a promotion system were created to be peer driven and incentivize learning, contributing, domain/tech mastery, helping others, and coaching? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss the radical Peer Promotion Process they have been working in for many years. Come hear stories that highlight the pros and cons of this approach.
