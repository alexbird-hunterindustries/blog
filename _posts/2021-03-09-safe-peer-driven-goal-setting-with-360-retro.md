Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Kind candor including giving and receiving feedback is arguably one of the most important aspects of high performing teams. However giving this feedback is one of the most difficult things to do for many. It is a lot to expect from people in an organization where new relationships are being formed all the time and psychological safety can be fragile. In response to this challenge, a safe peer driven system was co-created by several mobbing teams. Come join Chris and Austin as they share the experiences and results from experimenting with this system for several years.
