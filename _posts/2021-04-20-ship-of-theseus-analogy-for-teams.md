Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. If your team replaced all of its members over time, is your team functionally the same? What mindset and practices keep your team happy and high performing even through change? If team change is inevitable, how can you be good at it? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss the Ship of Theseus analogy applied to teams.
