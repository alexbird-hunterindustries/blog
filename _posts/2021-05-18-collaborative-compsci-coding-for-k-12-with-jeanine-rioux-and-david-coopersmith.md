Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective.

\"All the brilliant K-12 students working 
on the same thing... 
at the same time...
in the same space...
on the same computer...\"
How are you raising up the next generation of developers? Is there a way to teach kids programming that is less like a \"sage on the stage\" and more like a \"guide on the side\"? 
Join Chris and Austin as they discuss with #educators Jeanine Rioux and David Coopersmith how they have used collaborative coding techniques like #MobProgramming to teach CompSci for K-12 students. They not only share how they code with the kids in the classroom but also about how they set up annual #MobProgramming experiences for their students with Chris, Austin, and other professional engineers. Lastly, they discuss how they help themselves and other teachers pursue the goal of being life-long learners.
