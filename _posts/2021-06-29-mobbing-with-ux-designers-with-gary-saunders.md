Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. 
Do your UX designers, UI designers, front-end developers, and back-end developers work as a team?
Or individual silos?
#LeanUX may have removed some waste but #MobProgramming breaks down the interpersonal barriers to achieve true collaboration.
Misunderstandings fade away.
Empathy grows rapidly.
The customer receives the fully realized product vision born of a real cross-team effort.
We have seen this style of work increase flow, delivered value, and market experimentation.
Join Austin Chadwick and Gary Saunders as they present on the pros and cons of Mobbing with UX Designers at the \"Experience Design With Agile \u0026 Lean UX\" meetup.
