Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective.
How do you interview candidates? Do you ask them about their views on code, collaboration, and agility? Do you check their ability to recite facts related to the work and industry? Do you ask them behavioral questions about their past or about hypothetical situations?
Come join Chris and Austin as they transport you to a parallel universe for interviews. A universe where instead of talking about code and collaboration in an interview, the candidate actually collaborates on code with the team via Mob Programming. Instead of you hearing how they think they would act, see how the candidate actually acts. You not only see how they go about code implementation, but also refactoring, testing, interpersonal interaction, problem solving, learning, coaching, and design.
In addition, the candidate gets to know by experience what \"a day in the life\" is like in one of your teams to see if it is their cup of tea.
