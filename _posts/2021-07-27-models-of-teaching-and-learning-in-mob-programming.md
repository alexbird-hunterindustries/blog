Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. How do you prefer to learn? Do you prefer to run some experiments first and then later get guidance? Alternatively, do you prefer to first have someone with expertise model and guide you? Are there situations where one method is more effective than the other? Join Chris and Austin as they share about different models of teaching and learning they have seen work well in Mob Programming including the \"I do, we do, you do\" model and the \"You do, (and if needed, we do)\" model.
