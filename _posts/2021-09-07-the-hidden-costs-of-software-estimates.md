Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What is the cost of your development team making an estimate? Is the cost simply the time it takes to make it (e.g. in planning poker)? Or, are there any second order costs as well? For your estimates, what are the side effects of the side effects?
Join us as we discuss what many organizations have paid for their estimates. 
After experience in being on teams that estimate and experience in being on teams that do not estimate, we discuss costs such as:
- 80/20 Rule Gemfile Gemfile.lock LICENSE.txt README.md _config.yml _data _includes _layouts _posts _sass _site about.md assets autosaved_session.vim favicon.ico feed.json feed.xml index.html scrape.sh vendor Cost of Delay
- Design Trade-offs
- Estimation Creation Time
- Parkinson's Law
- Cost of poor security and data protection
