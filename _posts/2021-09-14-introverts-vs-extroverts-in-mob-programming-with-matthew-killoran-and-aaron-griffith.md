Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Is mob programming disastrous for introverts? Does it inevitably lead to exhaustion? Does it pit introverts and extroverts against each other? Does ensemble programming naturally lead to loud extroverts dominating the flow? Come join two introverts (Matthew Killoran and Aaron Griffith) and two extroverts (Chris and Austin) as they discuss introverts and extroverts in Mob Programming. All four have been doing mob programming full time for many years and in this episode they hit topics like the \"Both Stretch\" model and the \"Silent Sr\" model. Lastly, they discuss the \"28 seconds of silence\" experiment and run it live on the show! Yes, the \"28 seconds of silence\" experiment was hard for the extroverts, but it was good for them :)
