Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What do you think the future of product development is going to be? How about software development? If the good things you are currently experiencing are turned up to 100 in the future, what would that look like? Join Chris and Austin as they not only share their past and present of product/software development, but speculate about the future in regards to team, code, design, quality, and interpersonal growth.
