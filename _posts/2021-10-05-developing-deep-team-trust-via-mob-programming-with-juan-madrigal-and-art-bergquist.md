Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. 
As a leader, how do you develop trust with your teams?
As a team member, how do you develop trust with other team members?
Imagine trying to develop trust only by talking to someone a few minutes a day/week. Now imagine the parallel universe of Mob Programming where servants leaders/coaches work side-by-side with their teams for hours daily. Misunderstandings fade away. Empathy and trust grow rapidly.
Join us to not only see it described but also to see mobbing demonstrated live with a real team.
