Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. While a mob programming environment has helped many grow in coding skills, what is its impact on public speaking skills? How do lightning talks and mobbing help new programmers learn the art of presentations? What happens when concepts from lean and ensemble programming are applied to public speaking? Join Chris and Austin as they hear Reinier Pamintuan's first hand experiences with learning public speaking in a mob programming environment. Rei not only shares about public speaking in lighting talks, but also in stand-ups and monthly product demonstrations. Lastly, remote presentations vs. in-person presentations are compared and contrasted.
