Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. If learning quickly is a competitive advantage, what does it mean to have a learning organization? How do you cultivate this kind of environment where you work? Has \"working harder\" ever made problems worse? If so, what is going on at the system level? How can we better surface, test, and improve our internal pictures of how the world works? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss \"Learning Organizations and The Fifth Discipline\" where they walkthrough:
- Systems Thinking
- Learning and Experimentation
- Vision and Mastery
- Dialog and Shared Vision
- Learning Organizations and Mob Programming
