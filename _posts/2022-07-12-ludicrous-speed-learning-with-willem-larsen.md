Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Is there something that could put learning into hyperdrive in your context? For example, what environment, principles, and practices could enable onboarding to occur with speed and quality? Join Chris, Austin, and Willem Larsen as they not only share stories of \"Ludicrous Speed Learning\" but also discuss #EnsembleFirst as an alternative mindset and way to experiment with flow efficiency. In addition, they talk through organizational change in relation to ensemble programming, skills, and vocabulary (e.g., when to use the word \"mob\" vs. the word \"ensemble\").
