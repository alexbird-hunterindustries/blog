Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. How did you learn to communicate well? How do you teach emotional intelligence and tact to other team members? What are ways teams can interact with others where it feels like it's coming from a team and not just an individual? Come join Chris and Austin as they share how they write emails and learn/teach communication skills in an ensemble. Flow efficiency patterns and anti-patterns are covered. Email \"refactoring\" stories are shared. Come hear how collective ownership not only applies to code but also to communication, slides, and yes... GIFs!
