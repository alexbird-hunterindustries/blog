Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Heard of dedicated learning time but never experienced it yourself? Curious what people actually do during this mystical time? Join Chris and Austin as they share about what goes on in dedicated learning time. They not only give examples of some activities they have seen (e.g., solo vs. group learning), but they also share what they are doing in dedicated learning time right now. Topics also covered include learning how to learn and the interplay between production work and dedicated learning time.
