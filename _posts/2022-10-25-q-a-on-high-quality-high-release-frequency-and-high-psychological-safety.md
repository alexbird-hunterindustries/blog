Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. For software, what things lead to excellence and continuous delivery? For teams, what is conducive to innovation? To people speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, mistakes, and taking interpersonal risk? Come join Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick at this Q\u0026A session on \"High Quality, High Release Frequency, High Psychological Safety\" as they share from a #MobProgramming perspective. Stemming from that foundation, then Chris and Austin pivot to these specific questions from the audience at the Talabat event:
- How to keep mob programming effective remotely?
- How can a manager know who to promote in a mob programming environment?
- How to ensemble when there are schedule conflicts?
- Can you hire for mob/ensemble programmers?
- How to mob with people who do not want to mob all the time?
- How can mobbing be efficient? Don't I have better things to do with my time?
- How can a group of Android, iOS, and back-end developers cross-train? Is it worth the time investment?
- How to prioritize what to work on next when ensembling?
- How to handle complex dependencies between teams? Skill dependencies? Tech dependencies?
