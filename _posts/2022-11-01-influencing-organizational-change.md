Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Imagine you are put in a leadership position at a new organization. You immediately see many problems and areas for improvement in the system. What are some of the first things that you do? What are some things that you resist doing? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss influencing organizational change from the top/middle vs. the bottom. After Chris talks about avoiding the corporate antibody response, he shares his experiences on applying the \"Center, Enter, Turn\" principles. Next they discuss \"unhelpful forgetting\" and finish with how habits apply at the org and system level.
