Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. When coaching, when to make it easy? When to let it be hard? How can these two seemingly diametrically opposed objectives work together? Come join the conversation with Chris and Austin as they brainstorm to try to figure out the \"The Coaching Paradox.\" First, they share about the benefits of making a great environment where it is easy to do good things (e.g., systems thinking, classical culture shaping, etc.). Second, they talk about the pros of developing the ability to do good things even if they are hard (e.g., grit, classical courage and diligence). Then, they hypothesize on how to solve the paradox and bring the two good goals together as a coach.
