Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. For software development, what advice would you give that is generally true? If faced with choosing between two alternatives, what proverb more often than not is going to lead us on a good path? Our hypothesis: \"Favor Faster Feedback.\" Join Austin and Luis Martinez as they share at the 2022 Code Freeze Conference how this not only applies to test speed in TDD, but to almost everything in software development. Whether it is code, pipelines, product features, experiments, people, learning, or peer review, is fast feedback the path to the land of milk and honey?
