Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What is the \"day in the life\" like for a mob programmer at a different company? While many learn from experiments and experiences in their own company, what kind of things foster first hand learning from people in other companies? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss \"Cross Company Continuous Improvement\" with Jonathan Turner and Mike Clement where all share about their Developer Visitor Programs and their recent Mobber Exchange Experiment. Lastly, they chat about what's exciting in tech right now.
