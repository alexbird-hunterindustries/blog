Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. How do you collaborate with people from disciplines like finance and legal? What collaboration patterns with inter-dependencies lead to higher availability in the system, higher responsiveness, and faster flow? What collaboration patterns lead to more waiting, more queues, more context switching, and large batches? In response to a listener's request, join Chris and Austin as they reflect on multiple mobbing experiences with people from finance and similar disciplines.
