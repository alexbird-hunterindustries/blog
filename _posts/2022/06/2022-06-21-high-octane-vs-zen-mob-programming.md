Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What are the different styles of mob programming you have seen or experienced? Ever been in a mob that was \"Fast and Furious\"? An ensemble that favors autonomy first and is hyper focused on solving the problem in a more \"multi-threaded\" fashion with rapid cycles and lots of concurrent experimentation? On the other end of the spectrum, ever been in an ensemble that was more synchronized and peaceful? A mob that is more \"single-threaded\" and is optimized for consensus style decision making and learning? Join Chris and Austin as they share about their High Octane vs. Zen Mob Programming experiences. They first share about different ends of the mob style spectrum and then offer some possible suggestions for when to use each style type. Lastly, some tips are offered on how to join a mob and thrive when they are operating in a style different than you are used to.
