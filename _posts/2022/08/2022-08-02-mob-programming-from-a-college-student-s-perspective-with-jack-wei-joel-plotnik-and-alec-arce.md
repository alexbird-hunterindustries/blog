Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. You may have heard about Mob Programming from a professional developer's perspective. But have you heard about it first hand from a college student's perspective? Join Chris and Austin as they ask college students Jack Wei, Joel Plotnik, and Alec Arce about their ensemble experiences with other students and with professional engineers. Jack, Joel, and Alec share about what they liked and what they did not like in their weekly mobbing sessions. Lastly, as they reach the end of their college journey, they offer advice to college students who are just starting out.
