Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. If silos are problematic for technical knowledge, are they also problematic for product knowledge? Should product experimentation, decisions, and prioritization be owned by the \"single wringable neck\"? Or can it be owned by a team? Join Chris and Austin as they share about \"Collective Product Ownership.\" After they discuss the distinction between a siloed feature factory and a shared feature discovery shop, Austin shares a collective product ownership mob case study on an IoT cloud innovation. Come see how group customer interaction, group visioning, group diagramming, and group product experimentation is not only possible but also can be fun and effective.
