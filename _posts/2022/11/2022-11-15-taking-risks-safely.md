Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Ever been on a team that pulled off a big jump in innovation? What things made the quantum leap possible? What helped the team overcome any perceived risk in going for it? Join Chris and Austin as they share stories and thoughts on \"Taking Risks... Safely.\" First, they talk about following the Scout Rule for 1% gains vs. large improvement leaps. Second, they explore mob psychology in regards to risk and safety nets. Then they discuss making learning and experimentation easy with a limited blast radius including \"Yes, and...\" techniques vs. a flat \"no.\" Lastly, they cover the impact of leadership, chaos, and \"extreme\" suggestions.
