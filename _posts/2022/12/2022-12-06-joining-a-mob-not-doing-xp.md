Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Extreme Programming and Mob Programming go together like peanut butter and jelly. However, have you ever joined an ensemble that was not doing extreme programming? How did you handle it? What reactions were helpful? What reactions were not so helpful? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss the good, the bad, and the ugly for tactics in regards to joining a mob not doing XP. They share experiences on transparency with non-utopia ensembles including emotional shock and recovery in the midst of the coaching chaos. Then with a \"center, enter, turn\" mindset, they talk about specific things that have been helpful such as \"getting therapy,\" limiting coaching WIP, \"long game\" mindset, encouragement, and emphasizing without patronizing.
