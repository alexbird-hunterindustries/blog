Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What is the relation between confidence vs. competence? What does that relation have to do with mob programming? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss The Dunning-Kruger Effect. They talk about what they have discovered about The Dunning-Kruger Effect and the many different versions of the phases in the model (e.g., \"Child's Hill\" to \"Insecure Canyon\" to \"Grown-Up Mountain\" vs. \"Ignorant\" to \"Cultured\" to \"Expert\"). Then they discuss the relationship between the Dunning-Kruger Effect and mob programming, learning, experimentation, humility, and refactoring.
