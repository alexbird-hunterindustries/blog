Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Get ready for a stimulating new episode of the Mob Mentality Show! In \"Copilot: Mobbing with a Robot,\" we delve into the exciting world of extreme programming with Copilot.
How does Copilot stack up against ChatGPT in the mob?
Is Copilot a verbose extrovert mob navigator while ChatGPT is a reserved introvert?
What happens when you teach Copilot humor and memes?
And how can we \"jailbreak\" AI for good versus evil?
Join us as we explore all this and more, including using AI in interviews, setting context for Copilot with comments, and letting robots and humans each do what they do best. Don't miss out on this fascinating discussion!
