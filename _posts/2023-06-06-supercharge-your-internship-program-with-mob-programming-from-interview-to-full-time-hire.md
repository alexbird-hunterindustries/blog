Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Join us as we explore the transformative benefits of mob programming in a software dev internship program, taking you on a journey from interviews to potential full-time hires. Discover how we interview 10-20 intern candidates at once using mob programming, revolutionizing the way we assess their skills and potential. Explore the pros and cons of interns joining existing mobs versus having an independent intern-only mob, and learn the key steps to prepare for the intern mob experience. We deep-dive into the essential aspects of intern mob onboarding, project selection, and the crucial roles of intern mob coaches. We share how we witnessed the incredible growth as interns present their end-of-project demonstrations and gain valuable \"agile\" training at the culmination of their internship. But the journey doesn't end there – we delve into the exciting possibilities that follow the internship. Don't miss this episode that combines the power of mob programming, internships, and agile practices.
