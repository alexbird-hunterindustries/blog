  subtitle: Leading change requires more than analysis and arguments

I understand that many technical problems are also social problems, and a good
solution is sociotechnical. Social change is part of the work of a technical
leader.

In *Switch*, Chip Heath and Dan Heath explain how to bring about change. Before
reading the book, I concieved of leading change primarily as analysis and
argument: understand the problem, propose a solution, and make a compelling case
for the solution. Of course there is collaboration involved, but if we
collaborate we'll collaborate on understing the problme, on proposing the
solution, and on expressing the reasons for our solution.

In Switch, they show that effective change needs to address three areas:

1. our passion -- our emotions, identity, and priorities
2. our logic -- this is the part I was familiar with before
3. the practical steps

A proposal that is only logical might bring assent but not change. A proposal
that we connect with emotionally will make us keen to change, but if it's not
logical we won't carry it out. Even if it is logical and aligns with our
passion, if the practical steps are too difficult, we won't actually change. An
effective change proposal needs to appeal to our passion, our intellect, and
have a simple and actionable plan.
