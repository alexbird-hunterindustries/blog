Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. You may have heard of London style Test Driven Development (TDD). You also may have heard of Detroit or Chicago style TDD. However, what do these two styles look like \"out in the wild\" in real production code? How about on teams collaborating via Ensemble Programming? Come join Chris and Austin as they share about their mob programming experiences of London TDD and Detroit/Chicago TDD. They not only talk about the pros and cons of each style in practice but they also talk about when they have seen each style done well and each style done poorly. Then they get practical about when to \"shift gears\" to experiment with a different style to fit the situation of the code and the team/mob.
