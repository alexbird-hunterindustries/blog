Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. While the lean wastes of task switching, defects, handoffs, and relearning are certainty inhibitors of flow for a team, ever seen the waste of waiting on slow hardware muck up the works? What hardware setups for teams, ensembles, and mobs have you seen help keep things flowing? Join Chris and Austin as they share experiences with Mob Station Hardware. Chris kicks it off with the end of Moore's Law and the implications for processor architecture. Then they both share on the impact of hardware on test speed (e.g., approval tests) and mob lean flow. After talking about pet vs. cattle hardware, they touch on hardware resilience to failure and mob resiliency to hardware failure.
