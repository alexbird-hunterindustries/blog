Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Why do things not get done in tech? What gets in the way? What causes waiting? What causes re-work? Join Andy Kwong, Rei Pamintuan, Aaron Griffith, and Austin Chadwick as they not only share horror stories of things not getting done, but they also share joyous stories of things actually getting done. They discuss the wastes that cause all the madness with flow. Lastly, they explain and demonstrate how mob programming has eliminated these wastes in their context. FYI: The advertised lean coffee portion of this tech talk is not in this episode since there is a pending approval to share it publicly on The Mob Mentality Show.
