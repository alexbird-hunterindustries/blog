Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Ever heard someone say \"there's nothing we can do\" in a team or mob? Or, how about \"that's just the way it is\"? What effect did it have on the team? What was your response? Join Chris and Austin as they discuss The 1st Habit of a Highly Effective Mobber: \"Response-ability.\" They start with setting the stage regarding this topic's inspiration from the books Turn The Ship Around and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Then they talk about what \"response-ability\" means and its significance especially in an ensemble programming context. After they clarify the distinction between proactive vs. reactive, they dive into the impact of focusing on your circle of concern vs. focusing on your circle of influence. Lastly, they connect this habit to coaching, retrospectives, learning time, kaizen, and systems thinking.
