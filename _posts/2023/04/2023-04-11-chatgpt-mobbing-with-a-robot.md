Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What is it like to onboard a new robot to your team? How well does the generative AI navigate code on day one in an ensemble? What are effective ways the mob can interact well with ChatGPT? What ways are not so effective? Join us as we share our experiences with ChatGPT and Mobbing with a Robot. We first tell the story of ChatGPT joining a mob team for a month to work on a greenfield mobile app. Next we explore the times when the robot helped to produce great code with the ensemble vs. more problematic code. We then dive into the legal implications of having generative AI in the team. Lastly, we talk about setting the context for ChatGPT to be an extreme programmer, how this changes the researcher role in the mob, and how to capitalize on a robot's sense of humor while teaming.
