Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. What is your team's center? What is the north star? What side-effects do you observe when they are off-center? What outcomes do you witness when the team's center is on point? Join us for the latest episode of Mob Mentality where we delve into \"Begin with the End in Mind,\" which is the 2nd Habit of a Highly Effective Mobber (7 Habits). Our discussion includes topics such as finding your team's north star, being people-centered vs. principle-centered, and how to help a mob find their center through storytelling and coaching.
