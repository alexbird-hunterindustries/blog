Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. Join us as we explore unlocking true collaboration with the win-win mindset in the fourth habit of a highly effective mobber. We share experiences on the pitfalls of win-lose and lose-win scenarios within a mob and uncover the spirit of abundance versus scarcity mentality. After walking through the principles of \"win-win or no deal\" and the benefits of high consideration and high courage within a mob, we cover the challenges of low courage or low consideration. In response we share strategies for coaching and helping ensembles overcome these hurdles. Lastly, come discover the nuances of win-win internally within a mob vs. inter-team collaboration.
