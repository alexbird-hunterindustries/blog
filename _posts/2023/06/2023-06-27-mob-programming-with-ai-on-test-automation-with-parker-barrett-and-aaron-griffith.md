Chris Lucian and Austin Chadwick discuss all things #agile and product development from a #MobProgramming perspective. In this exciting episode with Parker Barrett and Aaron Griffith, we dive into the world of Mob Programming with AI on Test Automation. After a quick intro on Mob Programming, we explore the benefits of testing with both human friends and robot friends. We'll share our fascinating origin story of Mobbing with a Robot and explore how AI can drive test development in an ensemble. Discover how testing with robots can help us uncover ZOMBIES and learn about the limitations and warnings of this approach. Watch an AI Mobbing Demo where ChatGPT generates a Flutter app with unit tests, and witness the power of AI-generated test ZOMBIES using Copilot. Don't miss this opportunity to explore the intersection of AI, Mob Programming, and Test Automation!
