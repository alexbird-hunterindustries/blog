## Context

We were rewriting ~30 lines of code, supported by tests. To do so, we disabled
the tests for that code and deleted the 30 lines of code (leaving an empty
method and a handful of disabled tests).  One test at a time, we enabled the
test and wrote the code to pass the test.  Then, we committed to git.

Since the code was technically broken at each commit (the disabled tests
represented missing behavior), we did not want to push our changes as-is.

When the rewrite was finished (and all tests were enabled and passing), we were
ready to think about pushing our code. Instead of pushing broken commits, we
chose to squash the commits into one single commit, review it as a single
commit, and then commit and push following our regular process.

This post describes the squash, in case we (or you) want to repeat it.

Here's out git log before we started the squash:

Interactive rebase back to the last clean commit: 
```

git rebase -i 2a5ab91a3
```

This opens up a new editor window:

# Rebase 2a5ab91a3..f62d58425 onto 2a5ab91a3 (29 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
#         create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
#         message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
#         specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
# u, update-ref <ref> = track a placeholder for the <ref> to be updated
#                       to this position in the new commits. The <ref> is
#                       updated at the end of the rebase
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#

```

Next change the lines from "pick" to "squash" except for the first line - that one stays as pick as there needs 
to be a commit to squash to.

```

pick 12ddbb2c4 WIP - To Be Squashed
squash 512201560 WIP - To Be Squashed
squash 9f42f6ac5 WIP - To Be Squashed
squash 5335a7271 WIP - To Be Squashed
(etc.)
```

Then we save the file and git performs the rebase. (It shows `Rebasing (8/29)`.) Afterward, we're prompted to enter a new commit message, and we put
something temporary (we will update the commit shortly).

Then, our git log looks like this. Notice that master has a single commit on top
of the last clean commit. We left a "placeholder" branch at the end of our "wip"
commits so we could see the before and after. When we diffed `master` and
`placeholder`, they were identical, which told us the squash was successful: all
the same changes, but in a single commit instead of many.

```

Finally, we reset that commit so we could review the diff of all the squash and commit using our normal commit process.

```

git reset --soft HEAD^
```

Now we see a diff showing the combination of all of our WIP commits.
