## Context

We wanted to make many small changes which left our code in a broken state. After each little change we committed, but
we don't want to push those commits as-is because not all tests were passing. After a dozen or so changes, the code was
good again. We want one commit that has all our changes -- this is a good commit where the tests pass.

In the case that you want to consolidate many commits into one, you can follow these steps.

Here's out git log before we started the squash:

Interactive rebase back to the last clean commit: 
```
git rebase -i 1a1ab91a3
```

This opens up a new editor window:
```

# Rebase 1a1ab91a3..f62d58425 onto 1a1ab91a3 (29 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
#         create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
#         message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
#         specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
# u, update-ref <ref> = track a placeholder for the <ref> to be updated
#                       to this position in the new commits. The <ref> is
#                       updated at the end of the rebase
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#

```

Next change the lines from "pick" to "squash" except for the first line - that one stays as pick as there needs 
to be a commit to squash to.

```
pick 12ddbb2c4 WIP - To Be Squashed
squash 512201560 WIP - To Be Squashed
squash 9f42f6ac5 WIP - To Be Squashed
squash 5335a7271 WIP - To Be Squashed
(etc.)
```

Then we save the file and git performs the rebase. (It shows `Rebasing (8/29)`.) Afterward, we're prompted to enter a new commit message, and we put
something temporary (we will update the commit shortly).

Then, our git log looks like this:
```

```

Finally, we reset that commit so we could review the diff of all the squash and commit using our normal commit process.

```
git reset --soft HEAD^
```

Now we see a diff showing the combination of all of our WIP commits.
