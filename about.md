In the [Hunter Industries](https://www.hunterindustries.com/) software
department, we're not satisfied with doing our best; we'd like to do better than
that. We take time each week to learn and experiment so that our best keeps
getting better.

This blog has notes of some of the things we're learning and thinking about.
It's not comprehensive, and it doesn't necessarily represent the views of the
whole software department or of Hunter Industries.

As we grow our thinking, we expect our ideas to change, mature, and evolve. This
blog is a partial log of those evolving ideas. We're writing primarily for our
own benefit -- to synthesize our learning and share ideas with one another --
but publish some of our notes in case they help others.

Why "the cannery"? See [Make jam from what you
learn](/blog/2023/10/27/make-jam.html).
